<h1>rusl</h1>

A **really simple useful library**.

*This is nothing fancy. Just a bunch of useful code (including `Hello, World!`) in functions to speed up your programming. [The src code](/src/) is also useful for examples on how to do things.*

Still need syntax and not just [Emmet](https://www.emmet.io/) and [IntelliSense](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/intellisense) from [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)? This feature is comming soon!
