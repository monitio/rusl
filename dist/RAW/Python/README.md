This is the [Python](https://python.org) implementation of Rusl.

## How to use:
1. Copy [the rusl.py file](/rusl.py) into the same directory as your main Python file.
2. Import Rusl using `from rusl import *`
3. Use it in your projects how you would any other library.

> [!WARNING]
> If you are using it over multiple different folders, there is no simple way to import from one file only. For each directory using Rusl, you have to put [the rusl.py file](/rusl.py) in.
